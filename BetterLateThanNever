# My Old Silent GitHub

> I always wanted to love programming,  
but apparently I was doing it the wrong way...

Instead of changing my approach and learning the correct path,  
I stayed stuck in the wrong one for over **25 years**.

Yeah, that's kinda **stupid** and **shameful** —  
but it brings us to two important principles:

### 🔁 1. Better late than never  
### 🚪 2. The past is past — but the future is wide open

So here I am, pushing my first symbolic commit backdated to **2016**.  
Just a test. Just an empty file.  
But it's not about the file... it's about the shift.

---

From now on, every year will witness at least one commit.  
And I don't care how small it is.  
**A baby step is still a step.**

The question is:

> Will I keep repeating the past...  
> or will I finally start **walking forward**?

I chose to walk.  
I chose to **code again**.

Step by step.  
Block by block.  
One commit at a time.
